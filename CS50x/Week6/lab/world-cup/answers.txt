Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The first one is proved incorret.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I think after 1000 simulations the predictions is good enough.
